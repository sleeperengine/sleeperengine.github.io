## Overview
Unseen Machine is a cooperative stealth-action game in which up to four players jump into the role of robotic burglars. Their goal is to explore randomly generated dungeons, extract valuable artifacts and escape unseen. On the way to the objective the players must avoid robotic guards and steal everything that isn't nailed to the walls.

Unseen Machine focuses on fast paced gameplay, placing high speed evasive movement over slow and methodic sneaking. Each player can customize their robot with different looks and abilities to overcome gameplay challanges in different ways.

### Look and Feel
Unseen Machine is set in a retro-futuristic setting, combining clean scifi astethics with crt-monitors and cassette tapes.

The player sees this world from a first person perspective, for immersive and tense gameplay.

### Gameplay loop
The player starts out in their lobby. The lobby, allows other players to join the hosts session. 

### Playtime
Since each level is randomly generated Unseen Machine offers a great degree of replayability. The player will spend between 5 to 20 minutes for one mission, depending on the generated mission's size and complexity. To keep the player engaged and offer a longtime motivation, the player will experience [Meta Progression](#meta-progression) in-between the actual missions. Ideally this will make the player come back to the game regularly to unlock and play new content.

### Meta Progression
Completing a mission will reward the player with currency, depending on the mission difficulity and the score reached. The player can then spend the currency in the base for permanent unlocks. The player can unlock new gameplay features and visuals for their character.
